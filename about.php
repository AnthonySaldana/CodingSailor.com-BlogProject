				<h1>About Me & Coding Sailor</h1>
				<p class="h4 abouttext">My name is Anthony Saldana. I have come to be known by the nickname Arbie. 
				I currently (September of 2014) live in Whittier, with my fiancée and son.
				I'm a web developer. I've always loved technology and more specifically, computers.
				Since a child I was fascinated by them. I would have to say that the path to me becoming
				a programmer began when I took apart my computer for the first time. In some way I became 
				extremely fascinated with what was going on inside electronics (not just computers). 
				<br/><br/>
				In middle school I played the guitar (not too good at it) and I had a friend who taught me 
				how to take apart an amp and change parts to make it distorted. ( I liked rock and metal music.. still do.)
				I would go into my amp and rewire everything with different speakers and I was having fun.
				This really shot me in the right direction. Like I said before, I was amazed at how things worked from
				the inside. This led me to taking apart an old laptop just to see how things looked inside it.
				With one dead laptop and a dinosaur desktop the seed had been planted. 
				<br/><br/>
				Now jump forward a few years, I grabbed my first programming book during the end of high school. I think it was a few months before my
				senior year. The book was 
				<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-C-For-Dummies/dp/0470617977/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1410280616&sr=8-1&keywords=programming+with+c%2B%2B+for+dummies" target="_blank">
				Beginning Programming with c++ for Dummies by Stephen R. Davis.</a> It was a good book and I learned 
				things that helped me along the next few years. Now I dont use c++ today, but the concepts remain.
				During my Senior year in high school I took a c++ programming class at my local community college ( Rio Hondo College). ACtually I took two classes during that year.
				An intro and advanced c++ class. Anyway thats what began this path. During that time I knew that I wanted to write code.
				<br/><br/>
				I'm not really studying the C languages anymore, I had a little run with c# but now I'm running with web development. My passion lies at the back end of 
				web development, PHP and MySQL are what I really want to master right now. I have decent skills in the front end, but I want to program web applications, not so much design.

				<h1>Why Blog?</h1>
				<p class="h4 abouttext">
					I blog because I like to write. I use to have a blog where I wrote advice but eventually I just stop keeping up
					with it and let it die. I started this blog for a few reasons:</br></p>
					<ol class="h5 abouttext">
						<li>Develop a bloggin platform for experience - I developed this blog from scratch using php. Everything is hand crafted by yours truly.</li>
						<li>Write!! - Like I Said, I like writing. In fact I love it. I wanna write books someday. I also love reading, that might explain why i love writing..</li>
						<li>Learn. - What better way to better my development skills than to write about it!</li>
						<li>Help - This isn't just a tech blog. Alot of what I post will be advice, life lessons I've learned during the short years on this planet.</li>
					</ol>
				
				<h1>Where's this blog headed?</h1>
				<p class="h4 abouttext">
					My plans for this blog isn't just to write. I also have plans to make podcasts and video podcasts in the near future, So 
					I am very excited for that! For podcasts I hope to do things like talk about specific tech topics, give career advice, interview cool programmers and 
					just cool people in general, and maybe more if it comes to mind. I'm just giving an overview.
