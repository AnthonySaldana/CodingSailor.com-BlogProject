CodingSailor.com-BlogProject
============================

My blog, all code has been developed by myself. This blog is the best showcase of my ability.
I started developing this blog for two main reasons.
 1. I love to write.
 2. I wanted to get better at writing software.

I can say both goals are coming along nicely.

Highlights for this blog from a technical standpoint are as follows:
 
 1. Developed a custom login/registration system.
    - [x]Uses sessions to track user login
    - [x]database to store user login and new user registration details
    - [x]Developed in a secure manner of course. Is still being improved as I get better.
 2. User profile system
    - [x]Users are able to go to their profile and edit some info about themselves
    - [x ]Will be updating so that users can view each others profiles.
 3. Admin CMS
    - [x]Only available to myself - with proper login credentials
    - [x]Currently only allows me to post new blogs.
 4. Comment system
    - [x]Users will be able to comment on blog posts.
    - [x]Built on Discuss
    
This project is mostly to develop my skills.
