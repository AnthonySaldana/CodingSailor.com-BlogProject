CodingSailor.com-BlogProject
============================

My blog, all code has been developed by myself. This blog is the best showcase of my ability.
I started developing this blog for two main reasons.
1. I love to write.
2. I wanted to get better at writing software.

I can say both goals are coming along nicely.

Highlights for this blog from a technical standpoint are as follows:
 
 1. Developed a custom login/registration system.
    - Uses sessions to track user login
    - database to store user login and new user registration details
    - Developed in a secure manner of course. Is still being improved as I get better.
 2. User profile system
    - Users are able to go to their profile and edit some info about themselves
    - Will be updating so that users can view each others profiles.
 3. Admin CMS
    - Only available to myself - with proper login credentials
    - Currently only allows me to post new blogs.
    - Will be developing a simple analytics tool that displays traffic.
    - Will be developing a comment moderation system - once comment system has been developed.
 4. Comment system
    - Under development
    - Users will be able to comment on blog posts.
    - Comments will be secured for anti spam and security issues, of course.
 5. Always Refactoring
    - since i'm constantly getting better at writing software, my code is constantly being improved
    - Will be implementing new code in an oop design.
    - Will be refactoring old code to an oop design.
    
This project is mostly to develop my skills. But I do plan on releasing many of these features as an open source project.
Not sure if it will be a full cms, the future holds many questions.
